INSTALL GUIDE FOR CAMDOOM
========================================

0. Introduction

This brief guide explains how to download, install, and prepare CamDoom
on your machine. The following sections contain enough information to
know how to play this game, but you can contact losedavidpb@gmail.com
if you have any questions or issues! :)

1. Requirements

This section contains a complete list of the requirements that are
necessary to execute and play CamDoom. Please read carefully
and assure that you have met the requirements.

    1.1 Webcam

    CamDoom won't be playable if you don't have a webcam!

    1.2 Processing

    Before installing CamDoom, you should check that you have installed
    Processing 3.5.4 (https://processing.org/download) and the following
    libraries on your current machine:

    - Processing Sound library: https://github.com/processing/processing-sound
    - OSCP5: https://github.com/sojamo/oscp5
    - QueasyCam: https://github.com/jrc03c/queasycam
    - PeasyCam: https://github.com/jdf/peasycam/

    To know more information on how to install these libraries to Processing,
    please go to https://processing.org/environment/#adding-libraries-tools-and-modes

    1.3 Binaries

    Since PeasyCam does not include some utilities that are used at CamDoom, you must
    prepare the library with an updated version. To do that, go to the binary folder
    of this repository and move the JAR files to the library directory of PeasyCam.
    It is important to take into account that changes won't be applied until you
    restarted Processing IDE.

    To know the location of the folder on which you must move the JAR files, you
    need first to know the Processing sketchbook path.

    To know what is your Processing sketchbook location, open the Preferences
    window from the Processing application (PDE) and look for the "Sketchbook
    location" item at the top.

    By default the following locations are used for your sketchbook folder:

        For Mac users, the sketchbook folder is located inside ~/Documents/Processing
        For Windows users, the sketchbook folder is located inside My Documents/Processing

    When you have found the Processing sketchbook location, go to that path and then to
    "libraries/peasycam/library". The location in which you are in the place in which
    JAR files must be moved!

    1.4 Face Tracker

    Since CamDoom uses your face to know how to move the player, it is important to get
    the open framework ofxFaceTracker. Please download it using one of the following links:

        For Windows: https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxFaceTracker/releases/download/v1.2/FaceOSC-v1.11-win.zip
        For OSX: https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxFaceTracker/releases/download/v1.2/FaceOSC-v1.2-osx.zip

2. Preparation

If you are at this section, it means that you have installed all the necessary software,
since here you would prepare the videogame to then play it!

    - Connect your webcam on your machine and check that it is active
    - Execute FaceOSC.exe which is in the bin folder of oofxFaceTracker zip file
    - Open Processing IDE and open the CamDoom sketchbook (see https://processing.org/environment/#overview)

3. Gaming

If you have installed all the requirements, and you have also followed the steps explained
in the preparation section, it means that you should simply click the play button and play!
