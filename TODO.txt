CamDoom - TODO list
====================================

~ Game Features ~
- The game is in first person
- The difficulty is always the same
- The character always has a shotgun
- Shotgun fires unlimited bullets
- The game always takes place on the E1M1 map of Doom 2
- There are small medkits around the map
- Medkits heal a certain percentage of health
- There are two types of fluids, water and acid.
- The water is not so deep that you need anything
- Water does not damage the character
- The acid deals damage every so often to the character if he is on top of it
- Character cannot walk through walls
- The character always moves at the same speed (he can't run)
- The jump is not included
- The character can move forward and turn to the sides
- There is only one type of enemy (zombies armed with shotgun)
- Enemies do not drop any items
- Enemies if they shoot and hit the player, they do damage
- The player can deal damage to an enemy if the crosshair is pointed at the enemy (it is red)
- Can't look up and down
- There are no explosives, no projectiles, no melee weapons
- Simple tutorial for basic controls on a cube map
- A single shit texture for each structure (walls, floor)
- The map is not decorated with additional sprites except for the first aid kits
- AI is rudimentary, just enough to attack you
- There is nothing interactive on the map except for the medkits
